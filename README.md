## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I was scared about the gradient colors. Well not scared but it's like I was avoiding it for some reason. But after a quick search through the docs I realized that it is actually very easy to use and apply to anything you want.

### Continued development

In this project I focused mostly on the layout and making the site responsive. I am going to take a break now to continue learnig with freeCodeCamp and youtube videos. I need to have a better understanding about responsive design. I'll come back later to Frontend Mentor to continue with the challenges. This have been very fun and I've learned a lot already.
